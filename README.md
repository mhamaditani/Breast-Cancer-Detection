# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project tackles Breast Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project was done for Machine Learning and AI Course in the American University of Beirut </br>
The project implements explainable AI for Breast Cancer Detection by using Saliency Maps </br>
The model built in this project performs significantly better compared to generic models </br>
A full report on the model has been drafted and submitted during Fall 21
